# AKS-algorithm
Implementation of the AKS primality test algorithm in python. The implementation is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test.


## Efficiency:
Note that this implementation of the algorithm is not as efficient as it could be. This implementation will detect if a number is coprime pretty fast. Although, if it is a prime, it will take quite some time. Also, there are faster primality tests out there.
